    <h1>Configuration of input files</h1>
    Input files are in csv format with header file. <p/>
    Before the header there must be commented metadata for current file. <p/>
    First not commented row must contain headers. <p/>
    Rows after that will contain the data itself.
    <h2>Metadata</h2>
    In metadata there are two kinds of variables: Required and optional. <p/>
    Variables must be at the beginning of the file and each row must start with hashtag. For comments add two
    hashtags. <p/>
    Required values must be filled for application to understand what data is in that file. <p/>
    Optional variables are for extra information. <p/>

    <h3>Required variables</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>GENE_COLUMN</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Header of the column from where application will get the genes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ORGANISM</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Organism name who genes are in given input file.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GENE_ID_TYPE</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Name of the format in what genes in given input file are.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p/>

    <h3>Optional variables</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>DEFAULT_TAG_HEADER</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Header of column what should be selected by default when selecting given input file.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FILE_DESCRIPTION</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Description of the given file what will be showed in tooltip in selection of the files.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DEFAULT_GENES</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Example genes what will be added to the request when selecting given input file.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;HEADER_NAME&gt;</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>You can write description for the header, what will be showed in tooltip in selection of the headers.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p/>
    For &lt;HEADER_NAME&gt; variable example: <p/>
    if there is a header named "Disease", you can add description for that header as "#Disease=Possible Diseases" and
    that description will show up in
    tooltip. <p/>
